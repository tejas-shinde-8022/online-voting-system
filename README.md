# Online-Voting-System-Data-Structure-Project
This software project report outlines the development of an Online Voting System using C programming language, Linked List data structure, and the windows.h library for graphical interface design on the Windows platform. The primary goal of this project was to create an interactive voting application that allows users to cast votes for candidates, displays real-time voting results, and utilizes Linked Lists to manage candidate information efficiently.
Below is a brief explanation of the main components of the system:

1. Linked List:
A Linked List is a data structure that consists of nodes connected in a linear sequence. In the context of an online voting system, we can use a singly linked list to store information about the candidates, such as their names and vote counts. Each node in the list holds data related to a single candidate.

2. windows.h features:
The windows.h header file provides functionality for creating GUI (Graphical User Interface) applications on the Windows platform. It allows us to design windows, dialog boxes, buttons, and other graphical elements to make the voting system visually interactive.

To implement the system, you'll need to create functions for various operations, such as:

Initializing the linked list to store candidate data.
Adding candidates to the linked list.
Displaying the list of candidates on the screen with vote counts.
Allowing users to cast their votes by selecting a candidate.
Updating the vote count for each candidate based on user input.
Displaying the results of the voting process.
For the graphical interface, you can use windows.h functions like CreateWindow, CreateWindowEx, MessageBox, etc., to create windows, buttons, and other visual elements. You'll also need to handle events and messages, such as button clicks, to trigger the appropriate actions.

Keep in mind that this is a simplified explanation, and building a complete online voting system requires considering security measures to prevent fraud and ensuring data integrity. Online voting systems must be designed carefully to handle concurrency issues, protect against cyber attacks, and maintain voter anonymity.

Lastly, note that using C for building a graphical application is not the most common approach in modern software development. For GUI-based applications, other languages like C++ with a library such as Qt or C# with Windows Forms/WPF are more popular choices due to their extensive GUI frameworks and ease of use.
